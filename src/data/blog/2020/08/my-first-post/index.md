Finally, after 1 year delaying it, I have my own website where I can write my blog. How exiting! ðŸ˜€

Well not much that I can tell you now as this is my first post but I promise that I'll try to write a lot of interesting thing here. All my post maybe will focusing on React development and other stuff related to it but it doesn't mean that my post will be just all about React. I'll try to add with other things either it's from development world or just my mumbling (bear with me ðŸ˜†).

At the end, I will leave a good quote for future me to read.
