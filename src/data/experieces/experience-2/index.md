After graduate from bootcamp in 2019, I joined this company as a front-end developer. I mainly working with **"React"** here for developing website both used internally or for events ads.

Usually I use [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) as a setup and use either [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) or [Ant-Design](https://ant.design/) as UI framework. Working and discuss with team for project planning and requirement, also become may daily routine here.
